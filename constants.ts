  COMPREHENSIVE_PRODUCT_ANALYSIS_JSON: `You are an expert product analyst. Analyze the provided image to identify the specific product.
Your goal is to return a single, valid JSON object with the following structure and content:
{
  "productName": "string (Full product name, including brand and model, e.g., 'Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Noise-Cancelling Headphones')",
  "description": "string (A detailed description of the item, its key features, and common uses. Be thorough.)",
  "averageSalePrice": "string (Estimated average current market sale price for this product when new or in like-new condition. Provide a range if appropriate, e.g., '$250 - $300 USD'. If unknown, state 'Unknown'.)",
  "resellPrice": "string (Estimated average resell price for this product in good used condition. Provide a range if appropriate, e.g., '$150 - $200 USD'. If unknown, state 'Unknown'.)"
}
Focus on the primary product in the image. If multiple distinct products are clearly identifiable as primary, you may focus on the most prominent one or list them if the JSON structure can be adapted (though the current request is for a single object).
Ensure the output is ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any markdown formatting like \`\`\`json or explanatory text before or after the JSON.
Utilize web search capabilities if available to gather accurate information for pricing and product details.`,

# System Patterns

## System Architecture
The application appears to be a React-based frontend with Firebase for backend services (authentication, database, and cloud functions). AI analysis is likely handled by a service (Gemini or OpenAI) integrated via Firebase Cloud Functions.

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Frontend**: React for building the user interface.
- **Backend**: Firebase for scalable backend services.
- **AI Integration**: Firebase Cloud Functions act as an intermediary for AI service calls (Gemini/OpenAI).

## Design Patterns in Use
- **Component-based architecture**: Frontend is built with reusable React components.
- **Service-oriented**: Separation of concerns with dedicated services for Firebase, Gemini, and OpenAI interactions.

## Component Relationships
- `App.tsx`: Main application component, likely handles routing and overall layout.
- `components/ResultDisplay.tsx`: Likely displays the AI analysis results, which is where the feedback mechanism will be integrated.
- `firebase_functions_src/`: Contains Firebase Cloud Functions, which will need to be updated to handle feedback processing and AI model retraining.

## Critical Implementation Paths
- **AI Analysis Flow**: User input -> Frontend calls Firebase Function -> Firebase Function calls AI service (Gemini/OpenAI) -> AI result returned to Frontend.
- **Feedback Flow (New)**: User feedback -> Frontend calls new Firebase Function -> Firebase Function processes feedback and potentially triggers AI model update/retraining.

# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Implementing a new feature to allow users to provide feedback on AI analyzed results and enable the AI to learn from this feedback.

## Recent Changes
- Added feedback UI to `components/ResultDisplay.tsx` with "Correct" and "Incorrect" buttons and a text area for detailed feedback.
- Added `submitAiFeedback` function to `services/firebaseService.ts` for storing feedback in Firestore.
- Updated `handleSubmitFeedback` in `components/ResultDisplay.tsx` to use the new `submitAiFeedback` function.
- Fixed bug in `App.tsx` where AI analysis results did not clear when navigating between pages. Now, navigating back to "Analyze Item" from "History" calls `handleClear` to reset the state.
- Implemented client-side truncation for AI-generated string fields (`productName`, `description`, `averageSalePrice`, `resellPrice`) in `components/ResultDisplay.tsx` before saving to Firestore. This resolves the "400 Bad Request" error caused by oversized string data.

## Next Steps
1. (Future consideration) Develop a mechanism for AI model retraining/fine-tuning based on feedback. This is a complex task and considered a separate feature.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Feedback Storage**: Firestore is used for storing feedback data in a collection named `ai_feedback`.
- **AI Model Update**: The exact mechanism for "AI learning from feedback" is deferred to a future task. The current implementation focuses on collecting structured feedback.
- **UI Placement**: The feedback mechanism is placed near the AI analysis results in `components/ResultDisplay.tsx`.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Adhere to existing React component structure and styling.
- Use TypeScript for all new and modified code.
- Follow Firebase Cloud Function best practices.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The project uses Firebase for backend, which simplifies deployment and scaling.
- AI integration is abstracted through services and cloud functions.
- Feedback collection is now integrated into the user interface, facilitating future improvements in AI accuracy.

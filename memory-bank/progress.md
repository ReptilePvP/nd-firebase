# Progress

## What works
- Basic application structure is in place.
- Frontend components are defined.
- Firebase backend services are integrated.
- AI analysis via Firebase Cloud Functions is assumed to be working.
- User feedback UI for AI analysis results is implemented in `components/ResultDisplay.tsx`.
- Frontend logic to send feedback to Firestore is implemented in `services/firebaseService.ts`.

## What's left to build
- (Future consideration) AI model retraining/fine-tuning mechanism based on collected feedback.

## Current status
Feedback collection feature for AI analysis results is complete. The system now allows users to provide feedback on whether the AI analysis was correct or incorrect, with optional detailed feedback for incorrect analyses. This feedback is stored in Firestore for future use.

## Known issues
- The "400 Bad Request" error when saving analysis results to Firestore has been resolved by implementing client-side string truncation in `components/ResultDisplay.tsx`.
- None identified yet for the new feature. Previously identified bug where AI analysis results persisted after navigation has been resolved by updating `App.tsx` to clear state when navigating back to "Analyze Item".

## Evolution of project decisions
- Initial decision to use Firestore for feedback storage.
- Initial decision to integrate feedback UI in `ResultDisplay.tsx`.
- Decision to defer AI model retraining to a future task, focusing on feedback collection for now.

# Product Context

## Why this project exists
This project aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of AI analysis by incorporating direct user feedback. Currently, the AI provides analyzed results, but there's no mechanism for users to correct or validate these results.

## Problems it solves
- Lack of a feedback loop for AI analysis.
- Stagnant AI accuracy due to absence of continuous learning from user interactions.
- User frustration when AI provides incorrect or irrelevant results without a way to report them.

## How it should work
After an AI analysis is presented, the user should have an option to provide feedback, indicating whether the analysis was "correct" or "incorrect," and optionally provide a brief explanation or correction. This feedback should then be used to retrain or fine-tune the AI model.

## User experience goals
- Simple and intuitive feedback mechanism.
- Quick and easy for users to submit feedback.
- Users should feel that their feedback contributes to the improvement of the AI.
